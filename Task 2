# 💳✨ Credit Card Fraud Detector — Let's catch the sneaky transactions!
# Imagine you're a digital detective trying to spot shady purchases in a sea of legit ones 🕵️‍♀️

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler  # 🧼 Makes all features neat and tidy
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression  # 🧠 Our fraud-spotting brain
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix  # 📊 Our model's report card

# 1️⃣ Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("creditcard.csv")  # Replace with your actual file name
print("👀 First peek at the data:\n", df.head())

# 2️⃣ Split into features (X) and target (y)
X = df.drop("Class", axis=1)  # All columns except 'Class'
y = df["Class"]               # 'Class' is 1 for fraud, 0 for legit

# 3️⃣ Train-test split: study time vs exam time 🎓
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)
# Stratify = make sure frauds are evenly spread in both sets 🍰

# 4️⃣ Scale the features (Logistic Regression likes clean numbers)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# 5️⃣ Train the model — our brain learns patterns 🧠
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)

# 6️⃣ Time for the exam! Let's see how well it does 🎯
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_scaled)

# 7️⃣ Print the results — like checking your grades 📋
print("\n📊 Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\n📋 Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
