# 📱✨ Spam SMS Detector — Let's teach our model to say "Nope!" to shady messages!
# Imagine your phone has a smart assistant that reads every SMS and decides: "Is this spam or legit?" 🕵️‍♀️📩

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer  # 🧠 Turns words into math magic
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB                # 🧠 Our spam-spotting brain
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix  # 📊 Our model's report card

# 1️⃣ Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("spam.csv", encoding="latin-1")  # Replace with your actual file name
df = df[["v1", "v2"]]  # Keep only label and message columns
df.columns = ["label", "message"]
print("👀 First peek at the data:\n", df.head())

# 2️⃣ Convert labels to binary (ham = 0, spam = 1)
df["label"] = df["label"].map({"ham": 0, "spam": 1})
# 🧾 Think of 'ham' as friendly texts and 'spam' as sneaky ones

# 3️⃣ Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    df["message"], df["label"], test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
# 🎓 80% for study time, 20% for exam time

# 4️⃣ Convert text to TF-IDF features
# TF-IDF = Word highlighter pen ✍️📚 (marks important words in each message)
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words="english")
X_train_tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_tfidf = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# 5️⃣ Train the Naive Bayes model — our brain learns spam patterns 🧠
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train_tfidf, y_train)

# 6️⃣ Time for the exam! Let's see how well it does 🎯
y_pred = model.predict(X_test_tfidf)

# 7️⃣ Print the results — like checking your grades 📋
print("\n📊 Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print("\n📋 Classification Report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
